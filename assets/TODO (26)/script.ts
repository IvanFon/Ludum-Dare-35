/*
===absolute minimum like HOLY SHIT PLS DO THIS NOW AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA===
- Fix enemy bug
- Make sprites
  - lets aim for 3
- Add different attributes to forms --this should be really easy -- yeah, we'll start with 3 forms
- Make enemies attack


===Bugs===
- enemy spazzes when player is at about the same X (try jumping on enemy)
  - also when enemy jumps on playes head
  - stays spazzing if you die
- if enemy dies in air, floats (also repeats death animation twice, and whenever you come back from another tab)
- if enemies are pushing you against the border you can walk partially off the screen
- if both enemies are above you and you escape from underneath them, they will spaz-hover towards you until they hit the ground
- the word health in the top right corner is giant (either fixed or rare)
- can occasionally sink into the ground temporarily after killing an enemy above you.

===Strange Behaviours===
- enemies run on each others heads (not technically a bug), also on each other's heads on your head
- enemies try to jump on your head too much or just run into you
- you can kill an enemy on top of you and in front of you with one attack

===Required===
- Dead enemies lay dead on the floor
- Multiple enemies
  - Delayed entrance
- Different forms âœ“
- different abillities
- actual fighting
- waves
- enemy "ai"
- game over screen
- Fix death animation

===Extras that we're probably going to do===
- blocking

===Stuff that probably won't happen===
- make a cool game
